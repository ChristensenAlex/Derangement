# Derangement
This code calculates the number of derangements given a list of length n. A derangement is a permutation where no object appears in it's ordered place. For example a list of 2 objects [A,B] has 1 derangment [B,A]. The number of derangements given n elements starts with 1, 0, 1, 2, 9, 44 .... The code when run will continue that list. The standard method for finding derangments uses a sumation series. On the other hand this code calculates by taking n_factorial then subtract the dot product between the already known derangements with a row of pascal's triangle (without last element). I wrote this algorithm during a discrete math class. The method looked right but I wasn't quite sure. So I wrote this code to verify the algorithm's validity.
