# Derangement
Calculates the number of derangements. This program is for my discrete math class. The underlying math is hard to follow; instead of calcuating with a sumation series, which is the most popular way. The derangments are calculated by n_factorial subtract the dot product between already known derangements a row of pascal's triangle (without last element).
