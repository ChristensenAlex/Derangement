# Derangement
Calculates the number of derangements. This program is to help with discrete math. The math underlying the code is hard to follow; instead of calcuating with a sumation series, which is the most popular way. I found derangments with n_factorial subtract the dot product between a row of pascal's triangle (without last element) and derangements. My hope is this process is faster.
